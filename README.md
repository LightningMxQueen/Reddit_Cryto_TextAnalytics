# Analysis of different Subreddits about 'Crypto'

Note: This project originated as a work of 3 people. The repo only contains work done by me 

## Project

Different subreddits were analysed to consult a fictional 'crypto-startup'. Following anlyses were made:  
* Topic Modeling: What are the most important topics of existing coins?
* Network Analysis: Which fields are linked together and should be developed with each other in mind?

## Data

Scraped subreddits:  
* CryptoCurrency
* Bitcoin 
* ethereum
* CryptoMarkets 
* CryptoTechnology
* Ripple
* Monero

The data is stored in as a .sqlite DB in the folder data.  
To scrapper newer posts, run the script in the scraper folder (a detailed explaination can be found there)
